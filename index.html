<h2><li>Limit sugary drinks</li></h2>
    
   <span>
     <p>Sugary drinks like sodas, fruit juices, and sweetened teas are the primary source of added sugar in the American diet.</p>

     <p>Unfortunately, findings from several studies point to sugar-sweetened beverages increasing risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, even in people who are not carrying excess body fat.</p>
        
     <p>Sugar-sweetened beverages are also uniquely harmful for children, as they can contribute not only to obesity in children but also to conditions that usually do not develop until adulthood, like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p>
        
        <p>Healthier alternatives include:</p>

                <h2><li>Eat nuts and seeds</li></h2>
                <span>   
                <p>Some people avoid nuts because they are high in fat. However, nuts and seeds are incredibly nutritious. They are packed with protein, fiber, and a variety of vitamins and minerals.</p>
                <p>Nuts may help you lose weight and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease.</p>                    
                <p>Additionally, one large observational study noted that a low intake of nuts and seeds was potentially linked to an increased risk of death from heart disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes</p>
                 </span>
            
     <section id="Avoid ultra-processed foods"> 
               
                <h2><li>Avoid ultra-processed foods</li></h2> 
                <span>    
                <p>Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are foods containing ingredients that are significantly modified from their original form. They often contain additives like added sugar, highly refined oil, salt, preservatives, artificial sweeteners, colors, and flavors as well.</p>
                <p>Examples include:</p>
              </span>
              <div>
                <ul>
                   <li>snack cakes</li>  
                   <li>fast food</li>
                   <li>frozen meals</li>
                   <li>packaged cookies</li>
                   <li>chips</li>
                 </ul>
                 </div>
                 <span>
                 <p>UPFs are highly palatable, meaning they are easily overeaten, and activate reward-related regions in the brain, which can lead to excess calorie consumption and weight gain. Studies show that diets high in ultra-processed food can contribute to obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions.</p>

                 <p>In addition to low quality ingredients like refined oils, added sugar, and refined grains, they’re usually low in fiber, protein, and micronutrients. Thus, they provide mostly empty calories.</p>

                <span>
                <p>Despite some controversy over it, coffee is loaded with health benefits.</p>
                <p>It’s rich in antioxidants, and some studies have linked coffee intake to longevity and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and numerous other illnesses</p>
                <p>The most beneficial intake amount appears to be 3–4 cups per day, although pregnant people should limit or avoid it completely because it has been linked to low birth weight</p>
                <p>However, it’s best to consume coffee and any caffeine-based items in moderation. Excessive caffeine intake may lead to health issues like insomnia and heart palpitations. To enjoy coffee in a safe and healthy way, keep your intake to less than 4 cups per day and avoid high-calorie, high-sugar additives like sweetened creamer.</p>

               <span> 
                <p>Fish is a great source of high-quality protein and healthy fat. This is particularly true of fatty fish, such as salmon, which is loaded with anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids and various other nutrients </p>
                <p>Studies show that people who eat fish regularly have a lower risk for several conditions, including heart disease, dementia, and inflammatory bowel disease</p>

               <span>
                <p>The importance of getting enough quality sleep cannot be overstated.</p>
                <p>Poor sleep can drive insulin resistance, can disrupt your appetite hormones, and reduce your physical and mental performance.</p>
                <p>What’s more, poor sleep is one of the strongest individual risk factors for weight gain and obesity. People who do not get enough sleep tend to make food choices that are higher in fat, sugar, and calories, potentially leading to unwanted weight gain.</p>

                <p>The bacteria in your gut, collectively called the gut microbiota, are incredibly important for overall health.</p>
                <p>A disruption in gut bacteria is linked to some chronic diseases, including obesity and a myriad of digestive problems.</p>
                <p>Good ways to improve gut health include eating fermented foods like yogurt and sauerkraut, taking probiotic supplements — when indicated — and eating plenty of fiber. Notably, fiber serves as a prebiotic, or a food source for your gut bacteria.</p>

                 <span>
                <p>Hydration is an important and often overlooked marker of health. Staying hydrated helps ensure that your body is functioning optimally and that your blood volume is sufficient.</p>
                <p>Drinking water is the best way to stay hydrated, as it’s free of calories, sugar, and additives.</p>
                <p>Although there’s no set amount that everyone needs per day, aim to drink enough so that your thirst is adequately quenched.</p>

               <span>
                <p>Meat can be a nutritious and healthy part of your diet. It’s very high in protein and a rich source of nutrients.</p>
                <p>However, problems occur when meat is charred or burnt. This charring can lead to the formation of harmful compounds that may increase your risk for certain cancers.</p>
                <p>When you cook meat, try not to char or burn it. Additionally limit your consumption of red and processed meats like lunch meats and bacon as these are linked to overall cancer risk and colon cancer risk.</p>

               <span> 
                <p>When you’re exposed to bright lights — which contain blue light wavelengths — in the evening, it may disrupt your production of the sleep hormone melatonin.</p>
                <p>Some ways to help reduce your blue light exposure is to wear blue light blocking glasses — especially if you use a computer or other digital screen for long periods of time — and to avoid digital screens for 30 minutes to an hour before going to bed.</p>
                <p>This can help your body better produce melatonin naturally as evening progresses, helping you sleep better.</p>

              <span>
               <p>Most people do not get enough vitamin D. While these widespread vitamin D inadequacies are not imminently harmful, maintaining adequate vitamin D levels can help to optimize your health by improving bone strength, reducing symptoms of depression, strengthening your immune system, and lowering your risk for cancer.</p>
               <p>If you do not spend a lot of time in the sunlight, your vitamin D levels may be low.</p>
               <p>If you have access, it’s a great idea to have your levels tested, so that you can correct your levels through vitamin D supplementation if necessary.</p>

                <p>Studies show that people who eat more vegetables and fruits tend to live longer and have a lower risk for heart disease, obesity, and other illnesses.</p>

                <p>What’s more, this nutrient is particularly important for maintenance of a moderate body weight.</p>
                <p>High protein intake may boost your metabolic rate — or calorie burn — while making you feel full. It may also reduce cravings and your desire to snack late at night.</p>

                <p>Artificial trans fats are harmful, man-made fats that are strongly linked to inflammation and heart disease.</p>
                <p>Avoiding them should be much easier now that they have been completely banned in the United States and many other countries. Note that you may still encounter some foods that contain small amounts of naturally occurring trans fats, but these are not associated with the same negative effects as artificial trans fats.</p>

                <p>Excessive abdominal fat, or visceral fat, is a uniquely harmful type of fat distribution that is linked to an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease.</p>
                <p>For this reason, your waist size and waist-to-hip ratio may be much stronger markers of health than your weight.</p>
                <p>Reducing refined carbs, eating more protein and fiber, and reducing stress (which can reduce cortisol, a stress hormone that triggers abdominal fat deposition) are all strategies that may help you get rid of belly fat.</p>

                <p>Diets are generally ineffective and rarely work well long term. In fact, past dieting is one of the strongest predictors for future weight gain.</p>
                <p>This is because overly restrictive diets actually lower your metabolic rate, or the amount of calories you burn, making it more difficult to lose weight. At the same time, they also cause alterations to your hunger and satiety hormones, which make you hungrier and may cause strong food cravings for foods high in fat, calories, and sugar.</p>
                <p>All of this is a recipe for rebound weight gain, or “yoyo” dieting.</p>
                <p>Instead of dieting, try adopting a healthier lifestyle. Focus on nourishing your body instead of depriving it.</p>

                <p>Meditation is one such way, and it has some scientific evidence to support its use for stress management and improving health.</p>
                <p>In one study involving 48 people with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or both, researchers found that meditation helped lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and inflammation compared with the control group. Additionally, the participants in the meditation group reported improved mental and physical wellness.</p>
